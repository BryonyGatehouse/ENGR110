# Engineering Modelling and Design

This course introduces the role of modelling in the engineering design process. Different modelling techniques will be presented and techniques for evaluating each that can aid design decisions will be demonstrated. Practical work will support the learning of different modelling and simulation techniques.

## Course Content

ENGR 110 is a project-based course with four separate modules. The topics are as follows:
1. Finite State Machines
2. Sustainable Energy Systems
3. Artificial Intelligence
4. SCARA Robot Arm

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:

1. Explain and follow engineering processes involving specification, design, modelling, analysis and construction to solve engineering problems.
2. Construct simulations of formal models and explain the role of analysis and evaluation in the engineering design process.
3. Prepare a report presenting the outcomes of using a particular model to evaluate a design.
4. Work in a team, applying an understanding of how different skills in a team complement each other.
